The [Debate Map](https://debatemap.live) project is a web platform aimed at improving the efficiency of discussion and debate. It's crowd-sourced and open-source, and welcomes reader contributions.

Its primary improvements are (in short):
* Restructuring dialogue to make use of both dimensions.
* Breaking down lines of reasoning into single-sentence "nodes".
* Providing rich tools that operate on those nodes -- such as rating, tagging, statistical analysis, and belief-tree sharing and comparison.

The below is a screenshot from one of the debates:

The maps are constructed from “theses” (blue) which make claims, and “arguments” (green and red) which support/oppose those claims. This structure cuts down on reading time, and lets us focus on the underlying chains of reasoning instead of parsing statement meanings and connections.

### Workspace setup

1) Clone the repo to disk: <https://github.com/Venryx/DebateMap.git>
2) Run `npm install` in the root project folder.
3) Using git, revert the `node_modules` folder. (it has some git-tracked modifications, which get overwritten during `npm install`)

Note that I haven't thoroughly tested the setup process, so if something fails for you, I probably just forgot a step or two, so make an issue describing where you're stuck.

For recommended setup of your code editor and other tools, see: [Editor setup](#editor-setup)

### Firebase setup + project config

1) Create two Google Firebase projects -- one for development, one for production.
2) Edit the `.firebaserc` and `Scripts/Build/CreateConfig.js` files, replacing their paths and data with your own.
3) Add at least one form of authentication to your Firebase projects. (Google sign-in is easiest)
4) Run the project locally. (see "Running locally" section below)
5) Sign in, using the panel at the top-right.
6) Add "?init=true" to the address-bar url, and reload the page.
7) Press the "Initialize database" button which will appear at the top-left.

### Running locally

1) Run `tsc` (or `npm run tsc-watch`) in a console, and keep it running in the background.
2) Run `npm run dev` in the root project folder. (or `npm run dev-with-stats`)
3) Navigate to `localhost:3000`.

Note that if you add/remove/modify any modules required from `Scripts/Config/Vendors.js`, you'll then need to run `npm run create-vendors[-quick]`. (those modules are compiled separately, to speed up the main compile process)

### Deploying to Firebase

1) Run `tsc` (or `npm run tsc-watch`) in a console, and keep it running in the background. (this reduces deploy:prod-quick compile times from ~59s to ~32s, by enabling incremental compilation)
2) Run `npm run deploy:[dev/prod/prod-quick]`. Note that `deploy:prod-quick` time is ~32s, vs ~86s for `deploy:prod` (since the former doesn't use minification and such).

### Editor setup

The below are optional recommendations on your editor setup, which will make editing the project more efficient and less error-prone. (since it matches the setup I use)

Browser: [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome)  
Editor: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)  
VSCode extensions:
* [Search node_modules](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jasonnutter.search-node-modules): Very helpful for quickly opening files in modules under `node_modules`.
* [TypeScript Importer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint): Lets you press alt+enter to auto-import the current symbol from whatever module it's in.
* [TypeScript Hero](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rbbit.typescript-hero): Same as above. This one's not quite as nice, but picks up some that the above misses. Also, it has an "import all missing" command.
<!--
* [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint): Shows warnings when code does not match the project's coding style.
-->

### Troubleshooting

* If you get an odd compile error or the CSS does not seem to be loading for the site (when recompiling), try deleting the cache at "node_modules/.cache/hard-source".
